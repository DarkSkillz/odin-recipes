    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This warm, flourless chocolate cake with caramel sauce recipe is a rich, complex, bittersweet chocolate cake that
        is simple to make and loved by all.</p>
    <h2>ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup unsalted butter, cubed</li>
        <li>8 ounces semisweet chocolate, chopped</li>
        <li>2 3/4 cups white sugar, divided</li>
        <li>1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>6 eggs</li>
        <li>¼ cup water</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter the bottom of a 10-inch springform pan; line with
            parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Melt 1 cup butter in a large saucepan over low heat. Stir in chocolate until almost melted. Off heat, stir
            until melted and smooth. Combine 1 1/4 cups sugar and cocoa powder in a large bowl. Whisk in eggs until well
            blended; whisk in chocolate mixture. Transfer batter to the prepared pan.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until edges nicely puffed and surface is firm except for a small center spot that
            jiggles when pan is gently shaken, about 45 minutes. Cool cake in the pan on a wire rack. Run a knife around
            the sides of the pan to loosen the cake, then remove the sides of the pan, and invert onto a serving plate.
            Remove parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Combine remaining 1 1/2 cups sugar, water, and lemon juice in a heavy saucepan over medium heat; bring to a
            boil. Cook, without stirring, until syrup is deep amber in color. (Dip a metal spoon into syrup; lift it out
            of pan to check color.) Remove from heat; gradually stir in heavy cream. The mixture will bubble vigorously.
            If lumps form, stir gently over low heat until dissolved. Stir in 2 tablespoons butter.</li>
        <li>Cut cake into wedges while warm. Spoon caramel sauce over top to serve.</li>
    </ol>
