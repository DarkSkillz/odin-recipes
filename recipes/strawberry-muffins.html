    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These strawberry muffins can be made with fresh or frozen strawberries. If using frozen berries, thaw slightly,
        then chop with a knife.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup milk</li>
        <li>¼ cup canola oil</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped strawberries</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) Line 8 standard-sized muffin cups
            with paper liners.</li>
        <li>Lightly beat milk, oil, and egg in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>Mix flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl. Toss in chopped strawberries and stir to
            coat with flour. Fold in the milk mixture until just combined. Divide batter evenly among the prepared
            muffin cups.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the tops bounce back from the touch and a toothpick inserted into the
            center comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool for 10 minutes in the pan before
            removing to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>
